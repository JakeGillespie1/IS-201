While in those departments I increased customer satisfaction and demand. I also accepted and properly fulfilled a managerial assignment to temporarily work as a utility clerk at a different Kroger Company location to improve its appearance.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
